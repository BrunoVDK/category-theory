\fakesection{Pushout in \texttt{C++}}

We talked about products and co-products in posets before, where the term supremum and infimum applied. In this more general case applied on \texttt{C++} types a diagram of a pushout $D$ is as follows :

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
%\begin{scope}[yscale=1,xscale=-1]
	\node at (0,8) (1) {$E$};
	\node at (0,6) (4) {$D$};
	\node at (2,4) (2) {$C$};
	\node at (-2,4) (3) {$B$};
	\node at (0,4) (5) {$A$};
	\draw [<-] ([xshift=1mm]4.south) -- ([xshift=-2mm]2.north) node[midway,right] {$$};
	\draw [<-] ([xshift=-1mm]4.south) -- ([xshift=2mm]3.north) node[midway,left] {$$};
	\draw [<-] ([xshift=1mm]1.south) -- (2.north) node[midway,right] {$$};
	\draw [<-] ([xshift=-1mm]1.south) -- (3.north) node[midway,left] {$$};
	\draw [<-] ([xshift=2mm]3.east) -- ([xshift=-1mm]5.west) node[midway,right] {$$};
	\draw [<-] ([xshift=-2mm]2.west) -- ([xshift=1mm]5.east) node[midway,left] {$$};
%\end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\noindent Any superclass $E$ of $B$ and $C$ is a superclass of $D$. Which means that $D$ corresponds to a superclass that encompasses all the functionality that the subclasses have in common\footnote{One has to consider all possible superclasses of $B$ and $C$. Then $D$ inherits from all of those. Some superclasses may only declare a part of the functionality that's present in both the classes $B$ and $C$, yet together they declare all of it and nothing more or some wouldn't be superclasses.}.

\fakesection{Limit of the identity functor}

The identity functor \texttt{Id} maps a category to itself. The initial object is the object for which there's exactly one morphism to every object. When constructing the limit for \texttt{Id} any apex will correspond to an initial object (or there wouldn't be a natural transformation from $\Delta_c$ to \texttt{Id}). If there are many apexes (or initial objects) there will be unique transformations between them. Indeed, initial objects are unique up to isomorphism, which we knew already.

\fakesection{Pullback, pushout, ... in \texttt{Set}}

Starting from the diagram depicted on the previous page and applying analogous reasoning we can see that $D$ is the smallest superset of both $B$ and $C$. In the opposite category we get :

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
%\begin{scope}[yscale=1,xscale=-1]
	\node at (0,8) (1) {$E$};
	\node at (0,6) (4) {$D$};
	\node at (2,4) (2) {$C$};
	\node at (-2,4) (3) {$B$};
	\node at (0,4) (5) {$A$};
	\draw [->] ([xshift=1mm]4.south) -- ([xshift=-2mm]2.north) node[midway,right] {$$};
	\draw [->] ([xshift=-1mm]4.south) -- ([xshift=2mm]3.north) node[midway,left] {$$};
	\draw [->] ([xshift=1mm]1.south) -- (2.north) node[midway,right] {$$};
	\draw [->] ([xshift=-1mm]1.south) -- (3.north) node[midway,left] {$$};
	\draw [->] ([xshift=2mm]3.east) -- ([xshift=-1mm]5.west) node[midway,right] {$$};
	\draw [->] ([xshift=-2mm]2.west) -- ([xshift=1mm]5.east) node[midway,left] {$$};
%\end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\noindent Here, $D$ is the largest subset (every other set that's a subset of $B$ and $C$ ought to be a subset of $D$). A trellis visualises this and the terms supremum and infimum are in order.\\

\par\noindent As for the initial - and terminal object, they (trivially) correspond to the empty set and the set on which the category is based.

\fakesection{Coequalizer}

can you guess what coequalizer is?

\fakesection{Pullback towards terminal object}

should be product (prove)

\fakesection{Pushout from initial object}

should be coproduct (prove)
